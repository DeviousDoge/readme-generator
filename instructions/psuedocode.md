# overview
Use npm init to install node_modules before trying anything. 
Inquire, template literals, read/write/append file are need to knows for this.
Questions should be built around the professional readme guide template. Follow the TODO comments. You need to define the data before you build the template. /generateMarkdown will be essentially where the readmeguide template will be plugged. Get questions and inquire.prompt going and find a way to pass it into generatemarkdown. You want to import generateMarkdown to index.js. 

Template literals allow us to call methods within the curly brackets. You can use this to call individual functions when defining the strings in generateMarkdown. Figure out how to plug choosealiscencse link to the corresponding function, and make the users input determine the parameters of that link. Same thing with the badge link if thatâ€™s used.
