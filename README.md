## Description
This project was my first non-web application. It is designed primarily for myself in order to streamline and standardize the process of writing out README.md files. This app is made using node.js and the details of how the javscript worked are layed out in detail in the sourcecode. The readme itself has been made using this app. The app is entirely console-based, and node.js will need to be installed. Answer a series of prompts to in the terminal to create an entire readme without any need to manually mess with markdown nonsense. The file will be named 'README.md' when created, not the name of the title because thats the convention for readmes. The readme for this directory will not be lost after the first readme is generated. A backup is safe and secure in the 'official readme' folder. You would have to go out of your way to delete that. 
## Installation
Clone the app or download it directly from github. Install node.js. Open your terminal and change the directory to readme-generator. Run the command node index.js and follow the prompts. Your new readme.md will populate in the readme-generator directory. Save the file somewhere else or you risk easily overwriting it.
